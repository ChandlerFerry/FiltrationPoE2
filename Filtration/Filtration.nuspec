    <releaseNotes>* Added support for new Prophecies block item type
* All open filter scripts are now remembered on exit and reopened when the application is started rather than just the last opened one (#95)
* Filter sections are once again now expanded by default when scripts are opened, unless the new "Auto-expand all sections when opening scripts" setting is disabled
* A new Clear Styles button has been added which removes all styles from the selected block (#96)
* The Enable/Disable Block toggle button is now visible on both the Regular Block Items and Appearance Block Items views
* When there are too many block items to fit horizontally in a block a horizontal scrollbar will now appear
* Fixed the application freezing for a long period of time when Ctrl+A (Select All) is performed
* Fixed the Switch to Appearance/Regular Block Items text overlapping block items
* Fixed theme saving (blank theme files were being saved) (#83)
* Fixed checkboxes in Block Group Browser (#97)
* Fixed the Select Path of Exile data directory dialog appearing after every upgrade (#94)
* Fixed an issue where custom sounds were only populated from the default Path of Exile data directory rather than the configured directory
* Clean installs no longer prompt to select the Path of Exile data directory if the default directory exists</releaseNotes>
