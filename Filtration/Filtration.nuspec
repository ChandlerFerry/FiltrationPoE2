    <releaseNotes>### New Features

* Implemented copying and pasting of multiple blocks (multiple blocks can be selected by holding the Ctrl and/or Shift keys while clicking)
* Added Expand All, Collapse All, and Clear All Filters buttons to the Block Group Browser
* It is now possible to add/remove Block Groups from blocks (there is a new text box and a + button on each block in the editor)
* The Block Group browser now has an additional column of checkboxes which enables block groups to be enabled/disabled as well as shown/hidden
* Implemented a new auto-update mechanism - previous versions of Filtration will need to be manually uninstalled

### Bug Fixes / Improvements

* Fixed incorrect filtering behavior in the Block Group Browser
* Increased the maximum value of Quality block items to 30 from 20
* Changed default opacity of colours to 240 from 255
* MinimapIcon preview icons have been improved in appearance and now have a transparent background
* Fixed an issue where several section-related commands didn't correctly mark the script as unsaved
* The state (maximised/restored) and size of the application window is now remembered
* The visibility of the Section Browser, Block Group Browser, and Block Output Preview tool panes is now remembered
* The last opened script is now re-opened on when the application is launched
* Increased the HasExplicitMod block item limit from 1 to 8 since it is possible to use up to 8 of these blocks together to only match items that have an explicit mod from all HasExplicitMod block items within a block
* Changed the default colours of TextColor, BorderColor and BackgroundColor block items to sensible defaults instead of 100% transparent</releaseNotes>
